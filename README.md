## Executing Code

For running the code, you should must to make sure your python has the tkinter module.
After that, you can test the result by running the following command:

```python3 my.py 3 test1```

The first argument defines the number of agents, while the second defines what maze(In the .csv files) should
be used.

## Multi-agent graph exploration without communication
